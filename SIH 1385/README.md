Idea Description: The idea is to translate resource materials namely - old book pages, english manuscipts, research papers, documents, historical accounts etc. to a desired language so that people who are not familiar with English, can also get a look at these materials and understand them. The idea is to also make the application look more like of a dictionary than like a translator. The translated materials would be available for users where they can also download them for other uses.

Abstract/Summary: For the implementation, we use the python 'PyPDF2' module for extracting all of the text available inside the document/pdf/word file/image. We store this text as in the string format inside a variable. Then we use Google API - 'googletrans' to translate the full text from English into a desired language. Then we use 'Document' method from the python 'docx' module to convert back the translated text into a document. Regarding reading/extracting texts from an image, we use the python 'pytesseract' module and 'PIL' module and then the same procedure follows.

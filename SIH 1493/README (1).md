Idea Description: The idea is to signify and represent our rich cultural heritage, providing as much apt knwoledge as possible to tourists/visitors so that they can get a better understanding of our past and present. The representation is brought out in the form of both text and audio-visual format, with additional features that include tourism and history.

Abstract/Summary: Our application would scan a QR Code at a certain place of interest (say a museum or any heritage site), thereby displaying a to-the-point and brief description about that site/sculpture. Once it enhances the interest of the user, he/she can further use our application for discovering other places of interest, or research about the culture, of that certain place/state. We have 3 features, the 'Explore' feature, the 'Heritage' feature and the 'Culture' feature. For the Explore feature, we have used python 'opencv' for scanning a QR Code and PySimpleGUI for making the interface (which we further plan to shift to Kivy). Here after scanning the QR Code, the explore feature would display the information in the form of text, voice or virtual mode, as per the user's choice.
For the 'Heritage' feature, the user can just select his/her state in order to get all information about the astounding heritage of that place, including names of other heritage sites located.
The 'Culture' feature is also the same where the user has to select the state and hence he/she would be able to access all the information regarding the culture of that place - food, festivals, dance etc.
For all the information regarding the QR Codes, the Heritage and the Culture feature, the data would be drawn from a private database made by our dedicated team. For that we have used the python 'mysql' module.
